  "Here is another weekly bunch of links. Just so you know, there is only 55 subscribers so it's very confidential. But as I was telling a friend recently, even with no subscribers I would keep track of links that way anyways. So why not reach the extra yard to make it sharable? And actually, if I had too much mails to sent I would have to pay mailchimp. I'm so much totally not into business! And thanks Xenor for the weekly links he sends me. Feel free to also contribute if you have some links you want to promote."
