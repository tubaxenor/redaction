  "This week I worked a little more on the
  <a href=\"https://github.com/mose/greeby\">greeby</a> project, that should
  help me in the writing of this newsletter. I spent lot of time
  exploring sinatra, mongo, and ember.js. A lot of fun, but it's not ready yet.
  So I made a <a href=\"https://github.com/mose/greeby/blob/master/lib/tasks/generate_task.rb\">rake task</a>
  for the generation in the while. You can check what's planned (and participate) on the
  <a href=\"https://trello.com/board/greeby-platform/513fd48aa7ed906115001a04\">taskboard on Trello</a>."
